This folder contains the following files:

=> Matlab file “main.m” is the main script. Type “main” in the Matlab console to run everything.

=> Matlab file “reservoir_shape.m” allows us to visualise the relationship between head (water depth), storage and surface lake area.

=> Matlab file “water_balance_basic” contains the first version of the reservoir water balance.

=> Matlab file “water_balance_final” contains the enhanced version of the reservoir water balance.
This folder contains the following files:

=> Matlab file “main.m” is the main script. Type “main” in the Matlab console to run everything.

In detail: This code reads input data related to a reservoir, performs water balance calculations, 
computes hydropower production, and plots the results to visualize various aspects of the reservoir's performance such as withdrawals and non-exceedance probabilities.

=> Matlab file “reservoir_shape.m” allows us to visualise the relationship between head (water depth), storage and surface lake area.

In detail: it reads reservoir data from an Excel file and calculates the relationship between hydraulic head, reservoir area, and volume. 
Then, it plots the results in three separate graphs.
i.	Head-area relationship: with hydraulic head (h) on the x-axis and lake area (a) on the y-axis.
ii.	Head-volume relationship: with hydraulic head (h) on the x-axis and volume (v) on the y-axis.
iii.	Area-volume relationship: with lake area (a) on the x-axis and volume (v) on the y-axis.

=> Matlab file “water_balance_basic” contains an uncomplete water balance function for the reservoir.

In detail: the function computes the basic water balance for a reservoir, considering inflows, downstream demands, local demands, storage, releases, spillages, and withdrawals.

=> Matlab file “water_balance_final” contains the enhanced version of the reservoir water balance.

In detail: the function computes the refined water balance for a reservoir, considering inflows, downstream demands, local demands, storage, releases, spillages, 
and withdrawals, with the addition of intake levels.
