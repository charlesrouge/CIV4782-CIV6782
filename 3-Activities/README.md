At the start of the tutorial, you are given essentially the same water resource model you had at the end of tutorial 2, with all values in global variables 
"reservoir" and "flows". Files are as follows:

=> Matlab file "main.m" is the main script. Type "main" in the Matlab console to run everything.
It builds on the last version of "main.m" from tutorial 1 (with intake heights for demands) and adds a part for multi-objective optimisation.

=> Matlab file "preparation.m" is identical to Tutorial 2 file. 

=> Matlab file "water_balance_sop.m" is the same file as in tutorial 2. 
Its name comes from the fact that we use the Standard Operating Policy (SOP) to allocate water and determine the water balance.
