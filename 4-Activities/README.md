At the start of the tutorial, you are given essentially the same water resource model you had at the end of tutorial 2, with all values in global variables 
"reservoir" and "flows". Files are as follows:

=> Matlab file "main.m" is the main script. Type "main" in the Matlab console to run everything.

=> "preparation.m" is identical to the Tutorial 2 file.

=> "water_balance_sop.m" is the water balance, it is identical to the Tutorial 2 file. 

=> "rrv_indicators.m" computes the indicators R (reliability), R (resilience) and V (vulnerability). It is identical to Tutorial 2 solutions.

=> "performance.m" uses "rrv_indicators.m" to compute all the indicators from Tutorial 2.

=> "plot_regret.m" represents performance across scenarios and alternative decisions (levers).
