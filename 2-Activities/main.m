% This routine is the main one in tutorial 2.

%% Prepare workspace
clear all
close all

%% Part 1: Organise data, perform water balance

% Define global variables
global reservoir;
global flows;

% Get inputs to water balance
file_data = 'Conowingo data.xlsx';

% Call the data preparation routine
[reservoir, flows] = preparation(file_data);

% Variable
T = size(flows.month_index, 1); % number of time steps in simulation

% Call water balance routine
flows = water_balance_sop(reservoir, flows);


%% Part 2: indicators 

% New structure
indicators = struct();

% Hydropower: average annual production (MWh)
hp = 1000*9.81*reservoir.hydropower_efficiency*flows.hydraulic_head.*...

indicators.annual_hydropower = sum(hp) / 70;
