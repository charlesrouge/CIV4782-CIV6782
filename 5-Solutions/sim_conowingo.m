% This routine is a basic step-by-step version of the water balance with a
% standard operating policy (SOP), assuming downstream demand have priority
% over direct withdrawals from the reservoir
%
% Contrary to the "basic" water balance, a (unique) intake position is
% defined for direct withdrawals
% 
% Arguments are the two global variables:
% reservoir characteristics "reservoir";
% "flows" structure including inflows, monthly demands, and the month index
% for each time step
%
% Outputs are an updated "flows" structure with the time series of 
% storage, release, spill and onsite withdrawals. 
% All volumes in m3.

function [objs, flows] = ...
    sim_conowingo(reservoir, flows, reduction, reduction_level)

% Local variables
T = size(flows.inflows, 1); % number of time steps in simulation

%% Integrate decision variables

% Dummy demand for Baltimore with a dummy intake at "reduction_level"
local_demand = zeros(T,4);
local_demand(:,1:3) = flows.local_demand;
local_demand(:,4) = local_demand(:,2) * reduction;
% Don't forget to change Baltimore demand as a result
local_demand(:,2) = local_demand(:,2) - local_demand(:,4);

% Intake levels
demand_intake_level = zeros(4,1);
demand_intake_level(1:3) = reservoir.demand_intake_level;
demand_intake_level(4) = reduction_level; % Make sure it is in m

%% Perform water balance

active_storage = reservoir.max_storage - reservoir.min_storage;

% Initialisation of outputs
s = zeros (T+1, 1); % storage
s(1) = reservoir.initial_storage;
r = zeros(T, 1); % release
l = zeros(T, 1); % spillage
w = zeros(T, size(local_demand,2)); % withdrawals
head = zeros(T,1); %head

% Main loop
for t =1:T
    
    % Water availability (beginning-of-period storage + inflows)
    wa = s(t) - reservoir.min_storage + flows.inflows(t); 
    
    % Release rule: only take what's available in the limit of downstream
    % demand
    r(t) = min(wa, flows.downstream_demand(t));
    wa = wa - r(t);  % water availability update
    
    % Head for available water
    head(t) = reservoir.empty_head + (wa+reservoir.min_storage).^0.5 * sqrt(2*(reservoir.max_head-reservoir.empty_head)/reservoir.max_surface);
    
    % Several intake levels
    for i = 1:length(demand_intake_level)
        if head(t) > demand_intake_level(i) 
            % At-site withdrawals: meet the demand (if available) or take 
            % what's left
            w(t,i) = min(wa, local_demand(t,i)); 
            wa = wa - w(t,i);  % UPDATE water availability
        end % if below intake, we already have w(t) = 0
    end
    
    % Determine storage
    if wa < active_storage % reservoir can store all water available
        s(t+1) = wa + reservoir.min_storage; 
    else  % reservoir cannot, it is full 
        s(t+1) = reservoir.max_storage;
        % Now the amount (wa -reservoir.max_release) needs to be split up
        % between release and spillage (TO DO, several lines)
        r(t) = r(t) + wa - active_storage; 
        if r(t) > reservoir.max_release % need bound on release and update spillage
            l(t) = r(t) - reservoir.max_release;
            r(t) = reservoir.max_release;
        end
    end
    
end

% Populate flows structure
flows.storage = s;
flows.release = r;
flows.spillage = l;
flows.withdrawals = w;
flows.hydraulic_head = head;

%% Evaluate outputs

objs = zeros(3,1);

% Objective 1: Baltimore volumetric reliability (from both water sources)
objs(1) = sum(w(:,2)+local_demand(:,4)) / ...
    sum(local_demand(:,2)+local_demand(:,4));
objs(1) = - objs(1);

% Objective 2: fraction of Baltimore volume for which desalination is
% relied upon. This is the reduction * (1-reliability(demand(4))
objs(2) = sum(w(:,4) < local_demand(:,4)-1E-6) / T;
objs(2) = objs(2) * reduction;

% Objective 3: Chester reliability
objs(3) = 1 - sum(w(:,1) < local_demand(:,1)-1E-6) / T;
objs(3) = -objs(3);
