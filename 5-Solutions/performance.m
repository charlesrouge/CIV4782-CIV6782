% This is part of the Tutorials for CIV 4782-6782 at the U. of Sheffield
% by Charles Roug√©, Spring 2021
% 
% Evaluate joint performance of:
%   - reservoir: the physical infrastructure
%   - flows: water flows and stocks
%
% Fields within structure indicators are:
%   - reliability, 
%   - resilience, 
%   - vulnerability,
%   - "vul_percentage" same as above, but expressed as a percentage of threshold
%   - "failure_count" the number of failure events
%   - volumetric_reliability for demands
% In order, uses investigates are (PLEASE FILL IN)
% 1) environmental flows (ecological uses)
% 2) Chester residential demand
% 3) Baltimore residential
% 4) Peach Bottom nuclear plant
% 5) Flooding
% 6) Recreation
% 7) Hydropower

function indicators = performance(flows, reservoir)

% Local variables
T = size(flows.release, 1); % number of time steps in simulation
n = size(flows.release, 2); % number of time series

% Flooding

% Recreation

% While loop to get the summer levels of every summer

       summer_levels(y*92+1:(y+1)*92) = flows.hydraulic_head(t:t+91); % get the three next months of hydraulic head
       y = y+1; % on to next year
       t = t + 365; % on to next year
